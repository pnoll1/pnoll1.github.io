<p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>The projects below include current and previous products that I've designed.  I'll walk through the design process and analysis procedures for each.</p>

<p>This product is being created to fix issues I've found while riding.</p>

<a id="differential-mounts" class="anchor" href="#differential-mounts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Differential Mounts</h2>

<p>This part was created for the WSU Formula SAE team.</p>

<p>The part was designed to:<br>
1. Hold axles in correct alignment relative to wheel<br>
2. Mate to differential<br>
3. Mate to tripod joints<br>
4. Withstand drivetrain loading  </p>

<p>The part was designed using Solidworks to create a parametric 3D model.  The mounting points on the rear subframe and the geometry needed to mate to the differential and tripod joints were known.  The placement of the differential relative to the subframe and the geometry of the part between the frame and diffrential needed to be designed.</p>

<p>The placement of the differential was based on the wheel movement, pass-throughs on the rear subframe for the axles and allowable axle angles for tripod joints at wheel and differential. The wheel movement was determined using the static ride height and suspension travel to determine the range of motion. The wheel movement information was modeled in Solidworks and used with the model of the rear subframe to determine where the differential could be placed and keep the axles from hitting the subframe and stay within the angle limits of the tripod joints.</p>
